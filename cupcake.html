    <h1>Welcome to The Cupcake Shop!</h1>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="intro">Our philosophy is that cupcakes should be baked with <strong class="flashy">quality, local ingredients, and with love,</strong> obviously. We strive to use only the best ingredients in our little cakes so they taste better and you can feel better while you're eating them. For this reason, cupcakes don't stay very long because they are delicious <strong>and</strong> we want to maintain baking with the best ingredients possible. </p>
